GAUSS: **G**ene-set **A**ssociation analysis **U**sing **S**parse **S**ignals

GAUSS provides a powerful and computationally effective tool to perform gene-set (pathway) association analysis. The methods tests for any self-contained association between a phenotype and a gene-set and produces a p-value for the association.In addition, if there is a significant association, GAUSS identifies the genes within the gene-set that might be driving the association.
